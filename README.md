# -Book-Nook-Simulation
This is my code for the System modeling and simulation 7th-week assignment

# The problem
A quaint bookstore, 'Book Nook,' operates with a single checkout counter. The time
customers spend at the counter for checkout follows a distribution:

| Time Between Arrivals (Minutes) | probability | Checkout Time (Minutes) | Probablility |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 0.1 | 2 | 0.15 |
| 1 | 0.2 | 3 | 0.25 |
| 2 | 0.3 | 4 | 0.3 |
| 3 | 0.2 | 5 | 0.2 |
| 4 | 0.1 | 6 | 0.1 |
| 5 | 0.1 |   |     |

# Implement interarrival and ordering time in two ways:
1. Using exact numbers
2. Randomly generated numbers using a random number generator (based on the given
probability distributions).

Simulate 50 individual customers of operation for Book Nook with the current single
checkout counter setup.

Construct the simulation table, then calculate the following:
1. Average time in queue.
2. Average time in system.
3. Average queue length.
4. Server utilization.
5. Average waiting time.
6. Probability of waiting.
7. Probability of the server being idle.
8. Average service time.
9. Average time between arrivals.
10. Average waiting time for those who wait.
11. Average time in the system for the customer
